# `frontend/` — React + Vite SPA

> **Status (current):** Built + merged on `main`. Routes Start/Setup/Interview/Report
> implemented; **Tailwind v4** via `@tailwindcss/vite` (no config files); token-guarded routes
> (`lib/guard.tsx`); shared component kit (`components/ui.tsx`); typed client (`lib/api.ts`)
> covering every endpoint incl. the resume-profile preview (`GET /sessions/:id/resume`). The
> Interview screen uses `@livekit/components-react` (live captions + voice-assistant state).
> `npm run build` clean.

A **thin** client. Three screens, client-side routing, no SSR. The only reason JS exists here is
that the WebRTC client + LiveKit room connection must run in the browser. The static build can be
served by a CDN or by FastAPI.

See the [root plan](../plan.md) for the full architecture.

## Why React + Vite (not Next.js)
This is a logged-in app with no SEO/marketing pages, so server rendering would be unused weight.
Plain SPA + **React Router** for `/setup`, `/interview/:id`, `/report/:id`.

## Layout
```

├── vite.config.ts

    ├── lib/livekit.ts    # room connect helpers (@livekit/components-react)
    └── __tests__/
```

## Screens
- **Setup** — drag-drop resume upload; job-URL field; on scrape failure show a **paste-JD** textarea
  fallback; difficulty / target pay / role selectors; "Start interview" button. Polls session status.
- **Interview** — connects to the LiveKit room with the token from `POST /sessions/{id}/join`; mic
  permission, live captions/transcript, agent audio, end-call control.
- **Report** — renders overall + per-competency scores, strengths, areas to improve, evidence quotes,
  recommendations.

## Auth
- The **magic_token** (from the link the API shows on screen) is the only credential. `lib/api.ts`
  attaches it to every request; routes are guarded by presence/validity of the token. No login UI.

## Deps
`react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`, `@livekit/components-react`, `livekit-client`, `vite`.

## Verification
- Full UI loop on a sample candidate: setup → join call → view report.
- Scrape-failure path surfaces the paste-JD textarea; missing token blocks the guarded routes.
